		<p class="blocktext2"> Hi! My name is Deziah Amarie Gayle and I am a fifteen year old <strong>maker, engineer, computer scientist, web developer and so much more.</strong> &nbsp; I attend Unity Center for Urban Technologies and currently I am moving into the 10th grade. &nbsp; I also participated in Google's Code Next program, where I learned everything that I know today about web development. &nbsp; On the more personal side, I love reading books about things that can only be from one's imagination, I can watch any action film or RomCom. &nbsp; I have a weird admiration for corn and enjoys hanging out with family and friends. &nbsp; I am also a surprisingly busy teenager, which I know is something that can't be said by a lot of teens. &nbsp; But because of my desire to succeed I put myself into things that I know will benefit me in the future. &nbsp; I am also very passionate about my spirituality and very serious about my love for God. &nbsp; He is the reason why I am who I am today and why I have come this far into my engineering career as young as I am.&nbsp;</p>
