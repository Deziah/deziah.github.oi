        <h1>My Experience</h1>

        <p>The first time I ever did any type of coding was when I was in the third grade. I used cord.org, which was a very good way to expose young kids to the technology world. Code.org made something that could be so complicated, fun and easy to learn. This was the first time I coded and it stuck with me to this day.</p>

        <br>

        <p>When I went to middle school, in my sixth grade year, I worked with Girls Who Code. They were apart of my after school program and they taught me the basics to HTML and CSS. In seventh grade, a program called Elite came to my school. Here we learned how to build and program C3 Mindstorms. Last but not least, at the end of my eighth grade year, Google's Code Next, visited my school and gave a presentation about the program and this started my future. </p>
